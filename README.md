# Pixel-perfect Vector-based Ray-casting Platform Game Engine
2D Platform Game Engine based on a range of resources. Based on 2015 logic and work by Sebastian Lague, but completely upgraded the code to work with Unity 2019 and Visual Studio for Mac.

# Features
Full 'perfect' collision detection, using custom-coded raycasting, and not using rigidbodies.

Create vectors (Quads) and other shapes to design entire levels. Drag the respective c# scripts onto platforms to initialise them.

Choose a custom maximum slope which the player can walk up.

Moving platforms with:
- Optional waypoints
- Visual gizmos for each waypoint
- Choose to cycle between waypoints or not
- Adjustable platform speed and easing


# Next to be added:
- Wall-jumping
- Enemies
- Pushable objects
- Pullable objects
- Multiple levels (with a goal)
- Collectible items
- Scoring system / timer / lives
- Speech bubbles

More information coming soon.
